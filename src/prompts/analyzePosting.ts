// extracting a job posting into a role summary, requirements (with
// severity), and keywords. Matching those requirements against the user's
// profile is a separate step (src/lib/matching/) -- this call never sees the
// profile and never produces evidence, so there's nothing here for a small
// model to fabricate.
// In plain terms: this is what we ask the AI when it first reads a job
// posting, before we go figure out which parts of your profile fit it.

  return `You are a job-posting analyst. Read the JOB POSTING below and reply with ONE JSON
object and nothing else.

Exact shape (no extra keys, no markdown, no code fences, no commentary):
{"roleSummary":"…","requirements":[{"text":"…","severity":"required"}],"keywords":["…"]}

Rules:
- roleSummary: one or two sentences describing the role and what it does.
- requirements: at most 8 concrete qualifications a candidate must have to be considered --
  required skills, years of experience, tools, certifications. Postings often
  separate a "Responsibilities" or "Roles & Responsibilities" section (day-to-day duties of
  the job) from a "Requirements" or "Qualifications" section (what the candidate needs to
  bring). Only pull from the qualifications side. Do NOT include job duties/responsibilities
  (e.g. "coordinate with other teams", "maintain the architecture", "troubleshoot production
  issues") even if the posting lists them prominently -- those describe the job, not what the
  candidate must demonstrate. Do NOT include degree/education requirements (e.g. "Bachelor's
  degree in X") -- a profile has no matchable evidence for those, so they can never be
  anything but a permanent gap.
- severity: "required" if the posting treats it as mandatory, "preferred" if the posting says
  something like "nice to have", "preferred", "bonus", or "a plus".
- requirements must be listed in the same order they appear in the posting text.
- keywords: at most 12 skills/tools/terms, spelled as the posting spells them.
- Plain text only inside the strings; no markdown.

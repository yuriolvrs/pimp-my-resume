// What this file is: the prompt template and response validator for the
// per-requirement matching-verification LLM call. Unlike the old single-shot
// analysis, the model is only ever shown a short list of already-retrieved
// candidate atoms (see src/lib/matching/retrieval.ts) and may only select
// among their IDs -- it cannot free-type evidence, so there is nothing left
// to hallucinate. (An earlier version also asked for a free-text "note"
// explaining the reasoning; dropped because it kept fabricating claims --
// inventing missing skills not in the requirement, asserting years of
// experience the evidence couldn't show -- despite explicit instructions not
// to. Unlike atomIds/status, a free-text note has nothing constraining it to
// what's actually true.)
// In plain terms: this is what we ask the AI to double-check one requirement
// against a short list of profile snippets we've already picked out.

Exact shape (no extra keys, no markdown, no code fences, no commentary):
{"atomIds":["…"],"status":"full"}

Rules:
- atomIds: ids of the candidate evidence items below that genuinely satisfy the requirement.
  You may ONLY use ids from the CANDIDATE EVIDENCE list -- never invent an id, never return
  text instead of an id. Return an empty array if none of them satisfy the requirement.
- status: "full" if the evidence fully satisfies the requirement, "partial" if it's related
  but weaker than what's asked. If the requirement names several distinct skills/tools (e.g.
  "JavaScript, Python, Git" or "X and Y"), status is "full" ONLY if the evidence covers every one
  of them individually -- covering some but not all named items is "partial".
- If atomIds is empty, status is not meaningful -- still include it as "full".

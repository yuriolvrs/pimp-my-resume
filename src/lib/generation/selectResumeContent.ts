// What this file is: pure, deterministic selection/prioritization logic for
// Phase 4's resume generation -- no LLM call, no rewritten text. Every
// bullet and skill in the output is copied verbatim from the profile; all
// this does is reorder items within each section so ones already confirmed
// as evidence for a requirement (see matching, src/lib/matching/) surface
// first, cap each section to fit a one-page resume, and rank which projects
// to include by how much matched evidence they have. Replaces an earlier
// per-section LLM-rewriting design that was found, from a real generated
// resume, to fabricate content -- e.g. inventing "Developed scalable and
// efficient code using Java and Spring Framework" for an events-organizing
// role, backed only by the word "JavaScript" in additionalInfo. Selection
// instead of generation makes that structurally impossible: nothing here
// can ever say anything the profile doesn't already say.
// In plain terms: picks and orders which of your real accomplishments to
// show for this job, without ever changing their wording.
